		<h2>Common Vaping Myths</h2>
		<button class="accordion">Myth: Vaping is more harmful than smoking</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Fact: Numerous studies have shown that vaping is significantly less harmful than smoking. Vaping involves inhaling vapor instead of smoke, which contains far fewer toxic chemicals. Vapour contains only a small fraction of the chemicals in tobacco smoke and in much lower doses. [Source: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/e-cigarettes-an-evidence-update" target="_blank">Public Health England</a>], [Source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5466947/" target="_blank">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a>], [Source: <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/vaping-substantially-less-harmful-than-smoking-largest-review-of-its-kind-finds" target="_blank">King’s College London</a>]</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Myth: Vaping leads to smoking among youth</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Fact: Research indicates that while some young people who vape may go on to smoke, the majority do not. Most vaping by young never-smokers is experimental and short-term. Regular vaping is uncommon. The net effect of youth vaping at a population level is to displace smoking. [Source: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6937e1.htm" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a></a>]</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Myth: Vaping causes popcorn lung</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Fact: There is no evidence that vaping causes popcorn lung. The concern arose from diacetyl, a chemical used in some e-liquids, but most reputable brands no longer use it. Cigarette smokers are exposed to over ten times as much diacetyl as people who vape, yet smoking has not been shown to cause 'popcorn lung'. [Source: <a href="https://www.lung.org/quit-smoking/e-cigarettes-vaping/impact-of-e-cigarettes-on-lung" target="_blank">American Lung Association</a>], [Source: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/28/2612/5875664" target="_blank">Oxford Academic</a>]</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Myth: Vaping is not an effective smoking cessation tool</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Fact: Several studies have shown that vaping can be more effective than traditional nicotine replacement therapies for quitting smoking. Vaping is at least as effective as any other quitting method and is the most popular method for quitting smoking in Australia. [Source: <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010216.pub7/full" target="_blank">Cochrane Review</a>]</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Myth: Nicotine is a dangerous poison</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Fact: Nicotine, while addictive, is relatively benign in the doses used in vaping. Current evidence suggests that vaping is less dependence-forming than smoking. Additionally, nicotine is listed by the World Health Organization as an essential medicine for smoking cessation. [Source: <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/05-11-2021-two-new-tobacco-cessation-medicines-added-to-the-who-essential-medicines-list" target="_blank">WHO</a>]</p>
		</div>

		<button class="accordion">Myth: Vaping causes serious lung injuries like EVALI</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Fact: The lung injuries attributed to EVALI were primarily associated with the use of illicit THC cartridges. Standard nicotine vaping products have not been linked to EVALI. [Source: <a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/#/details?url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>], [Source: <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/vaping-substantially-less-harmful-than-smoking-largest-review-of-its-kind-finds" target="_blank">King’s College London</a>], [Source: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/28/2612/5875664" target="_blank">Oxford Academic</a>]</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Myth: Vaping is a gateway to smoking</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Fact: If vaping were a gateway to smoking, an increase in vaping would correlate with an increase in smoking rates. However, data shows that smoking rates continue to decline as vaping increases. Most youth vaping is experimental and does not lead to regular smoking. [Source: <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/smoking-drinking-and-drug-use-among-young-people-in-england" target="_blank">NHS Digital</a>], [Source: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6937e1.htm" target="_blank">CDC</a>]</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Myth: Vaping is more addictive than smoking</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Fact: Nicotine addiction is significantly influenced by the design and mode of use of nicotine delivery products. Traditional cigarettes are engineered to be highly addictive by delivering nicotine rapidly and efficiently to the brain, creating strong reinforcement with each puff. In contrast, vaping devices, while still addictive, generally provide a slower and less intense nicotine hit, making them less addictive compared to cigarettes.

		</div>

		<button class="accordion">Myth: Vaping delivers as much nicotine as 50 cigarettes</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Fact: A UK standard disposable vape with the highest legal level of nicotine (20 mg/ml) contains 2 ml of liquid, amounting to 40 mg of nicotine. This is equivalent to the nicotine delivered by smoking about one pack of cigarettes, not 50. [Source: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/28/2612/5875664" target="_blank">Oxford Academic</a>], [Source: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6937e1.htm" target="_blank">CDC</a>]</p>
		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Myth: Nicotine damages brain development in young people</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Fact: There is no clear evidence that nicotine, at the levels used in vaping, harms adolescent brain development. Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) is considered safe and is recommended for young people by health authorities. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, while nicotine can be addictive and affect brain circuits involved in attention, learning, and impulse control, the levels used in vaping are significantly lower than those causing these effects in animal studies.

		</div>
		<button class="accordion">Myth: The main reason children vape is because they like the flavors</button>
		<div class="panel">
			<p>Fact: The primary reason children try vaping is curiosity, followed by peer pressure. Flavor is a factor, but not the main reason. Research from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and other studies indicate that while flavors can make vaping more appealing, the initial curiosity and social influences play a larger role in why children start vaping.

		    <button class="accordion">Myth: Vaping causes seizures</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Fact: The claim that vaping causes seizures is based on cases of nicotine poisoning from ingestion, not inhalation. The referenced case involved a 15-month-old child who ingested liquid nicotine, leading to severe poisoning and seizures. This is not representative of typical e-cigarette use through inhalation. The ANU study was government-funded, which could influence its findings and conclusions. [Source: <a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2023/218/6/electronic-cigarettes-and-health-outcomes-umbrella-and-systematic-review-global" target="_blank">ANU Study</a>], [Source: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5300914/" target="_blank">Case Report</a>]</p>
    </div>
	<button class="accordion">Myth: Vaping led to the hospitalization of a 15-year-old</button>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>Fact: Dakota Stephenson, a teenager in Australia, was hospitalized with severe lung issues initially suspected to be EVALI. However, doctors later stated, "In conclusion, the evidence to support a diagnosis of EVALI is insufficient in this case, and an alternative explanation is far more likely. Therefore, this case report should not be regarded as evidence for a case of EVALI occurring in Australia."

	</div>
	<button class="accordion">Myth: E-Cigarettes Explode Frequently</button>
	<div class="panel">
		<p>Fact: While there have been reported cases of e-cigarettes exploding, these incidents are relatively rare and often linked to improper use or defective batteries. Using the devices according to manufacturer instructions and ensuring batteries are not damaged or exposed to extreme conditions can minimize this risk.

                <h3>Fact: Vaping regulations are important</h3>
                <p>Proper regulation of vaping products ensures their safety and helps prevent youth access. However, Australia's current prescription-only regulatory model has led to a thriving black market. A regulated consumer model with strict age verification and penalties for underage sales is recommended.
